Nec uCom-43 MCU
---

A Verilog implementation of the Nec uCom-43 4-bit microcontroller from 1978. I wanted to start with something simple for my very first Verilog core. I was able to synthesize it on a Spartan-6 board without too much trouble: the compiler complained about 8 unconnected signals but those are the output signals for the two A & B ports that are inputs only, and I didn't want to complicate things. The core was also tested with Verilator and connected to an emulated VFD to play Tomy Scramble (D553C192). About the ALU, I'm still not sure how it is possible to increment a 4-bit register while the ALU is XORing the two lower bits of DPH. I think there is an independant XOR circuitry for DPH only. I also had problems to figure out what is the correct port order for the OCD instruction. In the official documentation (`uCOM-43_SINGLE_CHIP_MICROCOMPUTER_USERS_MANUAL.pdf`), the C port contains the 4 upper bits: C,D ‚Üê I7...I0, but I had to reverse the VFD connections to make it work properly with Tomy Scramble.
